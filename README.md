# Problem Statement:

## Leveraging HR data for strategic decisions

Utilize the HR dataset to uncover insights that enhance employee satisfaction, retention, and business performance. Transform raw data into actionable information for informed decision-making, driving operational excellence and business growth.

To Convert Raw Data into Clean Data

In Excel, null values are typically represented as empty cells. However, sometimes they might be represented with other placeholders like "N/A," "NA," "None," or similar text strings. 

## Finding Null Values:

# 1. Blank Cells:

	Blank cells usually represent null values in Excel. To find them:

	Select the column or range of cells where you suspect null values might be.

	Go to the "Home" tab on the Excel ribbon.

	Look in the "Editing" group for the "Find & Select" dropdown. Click on it.

	Choose "Go To Special..."

	In the "Go To Special" dialog box, select "Blanks" and click "OK." Excel will select all blank cells in the selected range.

## 2. Text-based Null Values:

	If null values are represented using specific text strings (e.g., "N/A," "NA," "None"), you can find them using Excel's Find function:

	Press `Ctrl + F` or go to the "Home" tab and click on "Find & Select" > "Find."

	Enter the text string you suspect represents null values in the "Find what" field.

	Click "Find All" to see a list of cells containing that text.
